# Intermediate C++: Function Pointers

Function pointers allow you to pass functions as parameters into other functions, or save them to be called later on.
While fuctors only exist in C++, function pointers exist in C, and are frequently used for callbacks.
This example covers the basics of declaring/using function pointers and their syntax.
It also shows usage of function pointers for member functions.

# Setup

Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.
